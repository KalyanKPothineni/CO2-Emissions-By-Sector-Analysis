# CO2 Emissions By Sector Analysis
This repository contains the implementation of the "CO2 Emissions By Sector Analysis" using Jupyter Notebook. The analysis evaluates emission values by tracking long-term trends in CO2 and identifies globally the largest emitters across different sectors.

# Project Structure
- CO2 Emissions By Sector Analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and visualizations of CO2 emissions by sector.
- CO2 Emissions By Sector Analysis - Final Draft.pdf: PDF document detailing the final draft of the analysis, including methodology, findings, and conclusions.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:
- Python (version 3.6 or later)
- Jupyter Notebook

# Project Overview
The analysis covers the following key areas:
- CO2 Emissions by Sector: Charts illustrating the total CO2 emissions by sector, providing insights into which sectors are the most significant contributors to emissions.
- Top 10 Countries by CO2 Emissions: Bar chart identifying the top 10 countries contributing the most to CO2 emissions.
- CO2 Emissions Trends for Top 5 Emitting Countries: Line graph showing the trends in CO2 emissions over time for the top 5 emitting countries.

# Data Sources
The data used in this analysis is sourced from reliable public datasets, including:
- Kaggle Dataset: Contains a detailed record of CO2 emissions by sector with historical information.
- Carbon Monitor: Real-time estimates of CO2 emissions.

# Usage
This analysis can be used for educational purposes, policy-making, and further research into CO2 emissions by sector. Feel free to modify and expand the notebook to suit your needs.
